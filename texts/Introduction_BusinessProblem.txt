The amount of road traffic incidents is immense, it causes great damage to all the US families and is estimated a loss of $810bn every year. Therefore, being able to identify the factors that lead to a greater number and severity of accidents is really important and has a big incentive. One way that this problem can be addressed is with data science tools, using machine learning to create models that can forecast concentration of road accidents, for the people to prepare. It seems pretty obvious that the more important factors will be about the climate, day of the week, the influence of substances, and some other few. But the important thing is to be able to determine how these variables interact with each other. This could lead to a far better understanding of the traffic accidents, and being able to predict them with much higher accuracy. So in this project, we will be using a dataset of the severity and conditions of different accidents to create and test a model that is able to predict the severity of possible car accidents.
